# bc1ha
## PURPOSE
The **bc1ha** repository supports geospatial analysis in British Columbiaâ€™s forest sector at 100m spatial resolution. The repository has two goals: 1) streamline an annual update cycle to download and 
rasterize information that is made available through BC Data Catalogue and 2) generate derived variables, where varying degrees of manipulation (e.g. gap-filling, consolidation of multiple source data sources) 
have been applied to create the input variables used to drive simulation models. 
<br><br>
Derived variables are often a work in progress and should be used with caution.
<br><br>
bc1ha_grid.py: Command script that runs the annual update steps.
<br>
bc1ha_util.py: Supporting functions
<br>
bc1ha_map_roi: Graphics by region of interest

## ANNUAL UPDATE STEPS
Step 1: Download required layers and store as geodatabases for land use, land cover, disturbances, RESULTS, and VRI. The layers that are included should be listed in the Data Sources spreadsheet in the **fcgadgets.cbrunner.parameters** repository. (8+ hours)

Step 2: Update look-up-tables (LUTs). (7+ hours)

Step 3: Rasterize variables.

Step 3a: VRI and Forest Cover Inventory variables are too big to be rasterized in Python (wtih 32 GB RAM). In ArcGIS, rasterize the feature ID or the Forest Cover ID. Convert to TIFF. Export to local machine. 
Use ClipToRaster_ByFile to standardize grid extent. Use custom functions from bc1ha_util.py specifically designed to rasterize VRI and Forest Cover Inventory variables, using the feature ID as input. (10 hours)

Step 3b: Other time-independent variables (that are not too big for Python), use RasterizeFromSource function to rasterize variables. (20 min)

Step 3c: Rasterize time-dependent variables, including wildfire, beetles, defoliators, harvest, mechanical site prep, knockdown, planting (1 hour)

Step 4: Digitize Timber Supply Area (TSA) boundaries if they have changed. (1 min)

Step 5: Run scripts that generate derived variables. (~1 hour)
