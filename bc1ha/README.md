# bc1ha
## INTRODUCTION
The **bc1ha** repository supports greenhouse gas (GHG) balance estimation, accounting, and reporting in British Columbiaâ€™s forest sector.
<br>
<br>
The repository was developed to: 
* Consolidate source code used by BC's Forest Carbon Initiative (FCI)
* Share knowledge, methods and limitations
* Automate and streamline project design with BC information systems
* Benefit from the diverse ecosystem of existing and new modelling approaches
* Support complex policy decisions in land resource management
<br>
fcgadgets is written in the Python 3/Jupyter environment, benefitting from integrated libraries for simulation modelling, 
geographical information systems, data analytics, and application deployment (Downey, 2017).
